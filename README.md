Type System Manager V1.3

Command line tool to support managing IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation Type Systems.

See  the following material to understand the code.
 *  [Maintaining the Rational DOORS Next Generation type system in a configuration-management-enabled environment. Part 1: Manual procedures](https://jazz.net/library/article/92352)
 *  [Maintaining the Rational DOORS Next Generation type system in a configuration-management-enabled environment. Part 2: Automation](https://jazz.net/library/article/92554)
 *  [Maintaining the Rational DOORS Next Generation type system in a configuration-management-enabled environment. Part 3: Automation tool deep dive](https://jazz.net/library/article/92596)
 
 [Part 1: Manual procedures](https://jazz.net/library/article/92352) explains the best practices backing up the approach.
 *  [Part 2: Automation](https://jazz.net/library/article/92554) explains the basics how the automation works, very much like this readme. [Part 3: Automation tool deep dive](https://jazz.net/library/article/92596) is a deep dive in how to get the code, compile the code, buld the code and package releases. It also explains in great detail how the code works.

The Type System Manager provides the following commands

 *  **deliverTypeSystemByDescription** that uses string tags in the description to identify exactly one source stream and one or many target streams. The command then delivers the type system of the source stream to all target streams.

 *  **importTypeSystemByDescription** that uses string tags in the description to identify exactly one source stream and one or many target streams. The command then imports the type system of the source stream into all target streams.

 *  **exportConfigurations** to export the streams/configurations for components of a project area as target into a source to target mapping CSV file.

 *  **exportConfigurationsByDescription** to export a source to target mapping for the configurations of the components of a project area to a CSV file, where the configurations are streams and marked with a source or target tag as substring in the description.

 *  **exportAllConfigurationsByDescription** to export a source to target mapping for the configurations of the components of all project areas to a CSV file, where the configurations are streams and marked with a source or target tag as substring in the description.

 *  **importTypeSystem** to import a RM Type System from streams/configurations of a component into streams/configurations of other components using a CSV/Excel file describing the source and target configurations.

 *  **deliverTypeSystem** to deliver the changes to a type system in source streams/configurations of components to other streams/configurations for this component using a CSV/Excel file describing the source and target configurations.

## Manual Workflow

1. Export the streams/configurations to a CSV file using exportConfigurations.
2. Open the CSV file with an editor e.g. Notepad++ or Excel.
3. Find the configuration that is the source for the operation and copy the URL from the "target" column to use it as source configuration.
4. Paste this configuration URL into the "source" column's cells in the desired rows for the target streams/configurations. 
5. Delete all rows with no source configuration URL.
6. Save the CSV/Excel file.                                                                              
7. Run the desired command importTypeSystem to import the type system or deliverTypeSystem to deliver the type system changes providing the CSV file as input.

## Semi Automated Workflow

1. Use and maintain pairs of "tag" strings such as -sourceTag TSDSource_TS1 -targetTag TSDTarget_TS1 in the descriptions of streams
2. Export the streams/configurations to a CSV file using exportConfigurationsByDescription or exportAllConfigurationsByDescription.
3. Run the desired command importTypeSystem to import the type system or deliverTypeSystem to deliver the type system changes providing the CSV file as input of a source to target mapping.

## Fully Automated Workflow

1. Use and maintain pairs of "tag" strings such as -sourceTag TSSource_DTS1 -targetTag TSTarget_DTS1 in the descriptions of streams
2. Run the desired command importTypeSystemByDescription to import the type system changes, or deliverTypeSystemByDescription to deliver the type system changes from the source configuration to the target configuration.
